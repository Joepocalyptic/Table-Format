# Table-Format
Table Formatter that imports raw text from a file and turns it into a BBCode or HTML table. More languages to come! Made with JavaFX.
Newlines are read as the table row separator. You may choose the table data separator within the program itself. Here's
a valid file if your data separator was ':':

```
1:2
3:4
5:6
7:8
9:10
11:12
13:14
15:16
17:18
19:20
```

This will turn into a formatted table with your choice of table tagging or not.
